About Plug & Play
=============

Poderopedia Plug & Play Platform is a Data Intelligence Management System that allows you 
to create and manage large semantic datasets of information about entities, map and visualize 
entity connections, include entity related documents, add and show sources of information 
and news mentions of entities, displaying all the information in a public or private website, 
that can work as a standalone product or as a public searchable database that can interoperate 
with a Newsroom website providing rich contextual information for news content using it`s archive.

Poderopedia Plug & Play Platform is a free open source software (see License) developed 
by the Poderomedia Foundation, thanks to the generous support of a Knight News Challenge 2011 
grant by the Knight Foundation, a Startup Chile 2012 grant and a 2013 fellowship grant by the 
International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), to: 
a) Develop Poderopedia.org, a collaborative data journalism website that maps who is who 
in politics and business, and... 
b) Develop the Plug & Play Platform and release it for anyone to use it.
