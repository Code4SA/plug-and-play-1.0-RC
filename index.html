                to create and manage large semantic datasets of information about entities, map and visualize 
                entity connections, include entity related documents, add and show sources of information 
                and news mentions of entities, displaying all the information in a public or private website, 
                that can work as a standalone product or as a public searchable database that can interoperate 
                with a Newsroom website providing rich contextual information for news content using it`s archive.

                Poderopedia Plug & Play Platform is a free open source software (see License) developed 
                by the Poderomedia Foundation, thanks to the generous support of a Knight News Challenge 2011 
                grant by the Knight Foundation, a Startup Chile 2012 grant and a 2013 fellowship grant by the 
                International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), to: 
                a) Develop Poderopedia.org, a collaborative data journalism website that maps who is who 
                in politics and business, and... 
                b) Develop the Plug & Play Platform and release it for anyone to use it.
